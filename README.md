# GeoPotz (Online Store) 

## Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Development 

* GeoPotz is an online web store that allows users to make online purchases. This is a responsive website to allow for use with any device.   

* This is my Milestone Project 4 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website hosts all the features you'd expect to find with a modern online store and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Django framework.

## Website Structure and Features

### Wireframes

[View my wireframes in PDF format here.](https://github.com/BMorrell92/BMorrell_Milestone_Project3/blob/main/assets/wireframes/MS3Wireframes.pdf) It should be noted, that the wireframes do not exactly match the final product, however, it does capture the main structure.

### Typograhpy

The landing page text uses Rubik Pixels which provides a unique grainy effect.

### Website Structure & Features

The website consists of 6 pages. Each page has its own function for users to register, log in and access their notes. Page structuring and functionality was structured using the [Materialize Framework](https://materializecss.com/about.html). 

- Home Page:
When first visiting the website, users are greeted with a homepage which introduces the purpose of LogIt:

- IPhone SE
- IPhone XR
- IPhone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy S8+
- Samsung Galaxy Ultra S20 Ultra
- Surface Pro 7
- IPad

### Manual Testing 

- User authentication was tested and confirmed to be working. The following elements were tested:

  - Successful registration.  
  - Failed registration if username exists.
  - Successful Login.
  - Unsuccesful login if username does not exist.
  - Unsuccesful login if password incorrect.


- The following notes managment functionalities were tested and confirmed to be working:

  - Notes are saved and retreived to profile page.  
  - Notes can be created, updated and deleted.
  
### Challenging User Stories 

- *"As a user, I would like to create and categorise my notes."* - **The user can add notes to their account and assign a selection of four categories to those notes**
- *"As a user, I would like to access my notes on demand."* - **The user can access their notes at any time by logging into their account**
- *"As a user, I would like to update my notes."* - **The user can edit or delete their notes**
- *"As a user, I would like my notes to be secure."* - **The users notes are secured in their own account**

### User Feedback

I asked a small group of friends and colleagues to test the application. Any criticisms will be considiered for future developments. The Feedback was as follows:

- *"Easy to use and good for simple notes. However, it's a bit too simple if you want to start getting a bit more complex with your notes"*
- *"Slightly 90's looking, but it does a good job, and I might even start using it myself!"* 
- *"Good work! Only thing i'd suggest is a custom field for the categories."* 


## Bugs

### Resolved
- **HTML Validation:**
    - When I first passed the website through the html validator it was returning the following errors:
    <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/BMorrell92/BMorrell_Milestone_Project3/blob/main/assets/images/HTML%20Error.JPG"></p>
    To fix this I deleted the divs that were nesting the li elements.

- **App Methods:**
  - Whilst following the Code Institute Task Manager mini project I noticed some of the methods they were using were not working in my case. Specifically, the delete funtion used the "remove" method to delete an item from the database on the tutorial, but the "delete_one" method worked for me. Furthermore, the edit funtion used the "update" method to update items on the database on the tutorial, but the "update_retryable" worked for me. 

## Credits 

I would like to credit Code Institute for providing easy-to-follow content and all the necessary source code from their tutorials. Much of the source code from the Code Institutes Task Manager mini project has been repurposed for the benefit of this deliverable.
