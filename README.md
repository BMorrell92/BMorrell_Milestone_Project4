# GeoPotz (Online Store) 

## Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Development 

* GeoPotz is an online web store that allows users to make online purchases. This is a responsive website to allow for use with any device.   

* This is my Milestone Project 4 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website hosts all the features you'd expect to find with a modern online store and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Django framework.

* It is essential to highlight that this prototype might lack some advanced features, customisation options, and additional functionalities that would be incorporated into a final version. However, it does staisfy the requirments of Milestone Project 4. Please note, that any personal information or financial transactions used during the prototype testing are not stored or processed in a live environment. The purpose of this prototype is to provide a demonstration of the envisioned online store's core structure and features.

### Accessibility Testing 

I conducted accessibility testing to ensure our online store is usable and accessible to individuals with disabilities. We adhere to web accessibility guidelines and strive to provide an inclusive experience for all users.

  - Unsuccesful login if password incorrect.


- The following notes managment functionalities were tested and confirmed to be working:

  - Notes are saved and retreived to profile page.  
  - Notes can be created, updated and deleted.
  
### Challenging User Stories 

- *"As a user, I would like to create and categorise my notes."* - **The user can add notes to their account and assign a selection of four categories to those notes**
- *"As a user, I would like to access my notes on demand."* - **The user can access their notes at any time by logging into their account**
- *"As a user, I would like to update my notes."* - **The user can edit or delete their notes**
- *"As a user, I would like my notes to be secure."* - **The users notes are secured in their own account**

### User Feedback

I asked a small group of friends and colleagues to test the application. Any criticisms will be considiered for future developments. The Feedback was as follows:

- *"Easy to use and good for simple notes. However, it's a bit too simple if you want to start getting a bit more complex with your notes"*
- *"Slightly 90's looking, but it does a good job, and I might even start using it myself!"* 
- *"Good work! Only thing i'd suggest is a custom field for the categories."* 


## Bugs

### Resolved
- **HTML Validation:**
    - When I first passed the website through the html validator it was returning the following errors:
    <p align="center"><img src=""></p>
    To fix this I deleted the divs that were nesting the li elements.

- **App Methods:**
  - Whilst following the Code Institute Task Manager mini project I noticed some of the methods they were using were not working in my case. Specifically, the delete funtion used the "remove" method to delete an item from the database on the tutorial, but the "delete_one" method worked for me. Furthermore, the edit funtion used the "update" method to update items on the database on the tutorial, but the "update_retryable" worked for me. 

## Credits 

I would like to credit Code Institute for providing easy-to-follow content and all the necessary source code from their tutorials. Much of the source code from the Code Institutes Boutique Ado project has been repurposed for the benefit of this deliverable.
