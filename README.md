# GeoPotz (Online Store) 

## Milestone Project 4 - Full Stack Development 

* GeoPotz is an online web store that allows users to make online purchases. This is a responsive website to allow for use with any device.   

* This is my Milestone Project 4 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website hosts all the features you'd expect to find with a modern online store and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Django framework.

* It is essential to highlight that this prototype might lack some advanced features, customisation options, and additional functionalities that would be incorporated into a final version. However, it does staisfy the requirments of Milestone Project 4. Please note, that any personal information or financial transactions used during the prototype testing are not stored or processed in a live environment. The purpose of this prototype is to provide a demonstration of the envisioned online store's core structure and features.

## Website Structure & Features

### Wireframes

[View my wireframes in PDF format here.](https://github.com/BMorrell92/BMorrell_Milestone_Project4/blob/main/media/MSP4%20Wireframes.pdf) It should be noted, that the wireframes do not exactly match the final product, however, it does capture the main structure.

### Typograhpy

In the GeoPotz Online Store, we have chosen to use the Rubik Pixels font for the home page to create a visually appealing and engaging experience for our visitors.

## Testing Carried Out

### Unit & Intergartion Testing 

I have implemented unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components and modules within the application. The Django framework provides several components that can be unit tested to ensure the reliability and correctness of the web store. Furthermore, I conducted integration tests to validate the interactions and compatibility between different components, such as the shopping cart, payment gateway, and user authentication system. This ensures smooth communication and seamless integration of various features.

Here are some of the tests that have been carried out:

- **Models:**
  I Unit tested the models to verify that the data is stored and retrieved correctly. My test cases included:

  - Test the validity of fields, such as checking if required fields are properly enforced.
  - Test relationships between models, ensuring that foreign key and many-to-many relationships are working as expected.
  - Test custom methods or properties defined in the models to verify their functionality.

- **Views:**
  I unit tested the views to verify the functionality such as handling different types of requests, handling form submissions, and rendering the appropriate templates. My test cases included:

  - Test the response status codes returned by views for different types of requests (GET, POST, etc.)..
  - Test the functionality of form handling, including form validation and successful form submission.
  - Test the rendering of correct templates based on the requested URLs or view logic.

- **Forms:**
  I unit tested the forms to verify the validation rules, error handling, and data cleaning functions. My test cases included:

  - Test form validation by providing different sets of input data and verifying the validation errors.
  - Test form cleaning functions to ensure that input data is properly cleaned and formatted.
  - Test form submission and data processing, checking if the form saves data correctly or triggers any necessary actions.

- **Templates:**
  I unit tested the templates to verify the rendering and functionality of templates in conjunction with views. My test cases included: 

  - Test the rendering of templates and check if the expected content is present.
  - Test the rendering of dynamic data passed from views to templates.
  - Test the functionality of template tags and filters used in the templates.

- **Django Allauth:**
  I tested Django Allauth to verify user authentication and account management. My test cases included: 

  - The registration form validates user input correctly.
  - User registration triggers the expected email confirmation process, if enabled.
  - User accounts are created in the database with the correct information.
  - Registered users can log in using their credentials..
  - Authentication fails for invalid login attempts (e.g., incorrect password or non-existent user).
  - Authenticated users can log out, terminating their session.

- **Stripe Payment Gateway:**
  My test cases for the Stripe paytment gateway included: 

  - Successful Payment: Verify successful processing of valid payment details.
  - Invalid Card Number: Verify error message when an invalid card number is provided.
  - Expired Card: Verify error message when an expired card is used for payment. 


### Cross-Browser & Cross-Device Testing

 The online store has been tested on a wide range of browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. We strive to provide a consistent experience across different platforms, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Browser Compatability:**
  The website has been tested on the following browsers:

  - Chrome
  - Edge/IE
  - Firefox
  - Opera
  - Safari

  The wesbite and all it's functionalities work as intended on all broswers. 

- **Device Compatability:**
  By using Google Chrome's Dev Tool, compatability was checked on the following devices:

  - IPhone SE
  - IPhone XR
  - IPhone 12 Pro
  - Pixel 5
  - Samsung Galaxy S8+
  - Samsung Galaxy Ultra S20 Ultra
  - Surface Pro 7
  - IPad
  - IPad Pro

 The website was found to be responsive on all devices.


### User Acceptance Testing

 I involved real users to perform user acceptance testing (UAT) and gather feedback on their experience. This helps us identify any usability issues, gather user insights, and make improvements based on actual user interactions. The Feedback was as follows:

- *"Good work! Pretty much what you'd expect from an online store."*
- *"Decent effort. Could do with some more products though."* 
- *"Good job. My main gripe is with the performance. Loading time takes away from the user experience"* 

### Lighthouse Reports 

I conducted accessibility and performance testing to ensure the online store is usable and accessible. This was done using the Lighthouse reporting feature in Chrome Developer Tools. In general, the website was assessed to perform poorly, but scored well on accessibility. Future fixes will have to involve improving the performance of the website. The performance reports on the main pages can be seen below:

## Future Testing 

- Security Testing: Before this being rolled out as a functional online store, vulnerability assessments will need to be carried out to ensure the safety of customer data and protect against potential security threats. 

- Performance Testing: Further testing and investigation will be required on the performance of the online store to ensure fast loading times, optimal server response, and scalability. This will help deliver a smooth and efficient shopping experience.

- Automated Emails: Once automated emails have been enabled, their functionality will be tested.


## Bugs

### Unresolved

- **Performance - To resolve website performance issues, the following approaches will be considered:**
    - Optimize images: Compress and resize images to reduce file sizes.
    - Minify and combine CSS and JavaScript files.
    - Evaluate server resources for efficient handling of user load.
    - Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources.
    - Profile and optimize critical code sections.
